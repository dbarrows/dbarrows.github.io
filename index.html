        <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I'm a programmer and researcher working at the Biophotonics and Bioengineering Laboratory (BBL) under Dr. Victor Yang. My research interests include GPU-accelerated medical image processing, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and computational anatomy segmentation.</p>
            <p>I recently completed a Masters degree in Applied Mathematics with a focus on Epidemic Forecasting at McMaster University. You can read about it <a href="http://hdl.handle.net/11375/19103">here</a>, or check out the code <a href="https://github.com/dbarrows/nls-forecast">here</a>.</p>
            <p>I previously wrote <a href="https://github.com/dbarrows/mars">MARS</a> as part of my undergraduate (BSc Mathematics / Computer Science) thesis, which is MATLAB software for modelling the evolution of systems of chemical reactions.</p>
