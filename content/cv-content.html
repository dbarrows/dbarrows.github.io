<li><strong>Title:</strong> <em>A Comparative Study of Techniques for Estimation and Inference of Nonlinear Stochastic Time series</em></li>
<li><strong>Supervisor:</strong> Dr. Ben Bolker</li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Studied epidemic modelling and forecasting using mechanistic, semi-mechanistic, statistical, and computational approaches, such as Hamiltonian MCMC, Iterated Filtering 2, and S-mapping algorithms.</li>
<li><p><strong>Abstract</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Forecasting tools play an important role in public response to epidemics. Despite this, limited work has been done in comparing best-in-class techniques across the broad spectrum of time series forecasting methodologies. Forecasting frameworks were developed that utilised three methods designed to work with nonlinear dynamics: Iterated Filtering (IF) 2, Hamiltonian MCMC (HMC), and S-mapping. These were compared in several forecasting scenarios including a seasonal epidemic and a spatiotemporal epidemic. IF2 combined with parametric bootstrapping produced superior predictions in all scenarios. S-mapping combined with Dewdrop Regression produced forecasts slightly less-accurate than IF2 and HMC, but demonstrated vastly reduced running times. Hence, S-mapping with or without Dewdrop Regression should be used to glean initial insight into future epidemic behaviour, while IF2 and parametric bootstrapping should be used to refine forecast estimates in time.</p>

<li><strong>Title:</strong> <em>Software for Multi-level Monte-Carlo Simulation of Stochastic Biochemical Kinetics</em></li>
<li><strong>Supervisor:</strong> Dr. Silvana Ilie</li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Developed software utilizing cutting-edge algorithms for simulating systems of biochemical reactions in MATLAB, including parallel and GPU-accelerated implementations.</li>
<li><p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stochastic models for systems of biochemical reactions are essential to the field of Systems Biology. While the Chemical Master Equation provides accurate predictions of future states of well-stirred biochemical systems, the solutions to this model are too analytically complex to obtain for realistic systems, and direct numerical methods are likewise too computationally complex to be a feasible solution. Thus, Monte Carlo-type methods such as the Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA) are utilized by scientists to obtain results consistent with solutions to the Chemical Master Equation but with drastically reduced complexity. This thesis discusses our program for the simulation of stochastic models of well-stirred biochemical kinetics, the Modelling Arrays of Reaction Software (MARS). Among other simulation methods, we implemented a very recent and advanced numerical strategy to estimate the average behaviour of the biochemical system, the multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) tau-leaping method. We compared the predictions of the MLMC with those of the exact SSA. The results showed excellent agreement, with the multilevel Monte Carlo tau-leaping method demonstrating a greatly reduced running time.</p>
