# About Me

I'm a software developer working at 7D surgical. I previously worked at the Biophotonics and Bioengineering Laboratory (BBL) at Ryerson University and Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre. My research interests include GPU-accelerated medical image processing, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and computational anatomy segmentation.

I recently completed a Masters degree in Applied Mathematics with a focus on epidemic forecasting at McMaster University. You can read about it [here](http://hdl.handle.net/11375/19103), or check out the code [here](https://github.com/dbarrows/nls-forecast).

I previously wrote [MARS](https://github.com/dbarrows/mars) as part of my undergraduate (BSc Mathematics / Computer Science) thesis, which is MATLAB software for modelling the evolution of systems of chemical reactions.
